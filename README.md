## Description

CakePals is a place where people can sell home-baked cakes to each other. There are bakers who can
register on CakePals and list their delicious cakes for sale. There are also cake lovers who are eager to
explore new flavours. A customer typically looks for available offerings nearby, creates a member
account  and places a baking order. Bakers receive orders, bake cakes and hand them over
at the agreed collection time. Refer to the Appendix for an example.
